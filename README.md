# SDSS_EPO
This repository holds SciServer activities using SDSS data. The target audience is intro science students at tertiary level.

Note these notebooks need to be uploaded and run on the <a href="https://apps.sciserver.org/">SciServer Compute</a> platform. You (and every individual student) will need a SciServer account to run on this platform. When you create a SciServer account you are also given an account for <a href="https://skyserver.sdss.org/CasJobs/">SDSS CASJobs</a>. This is useful as the stars notebook creates a table in CASJobs MyDB. If you need to delete this table (due to an error or some other reason) then you can log in to CASJobs, go to MyDB and drop the table.
